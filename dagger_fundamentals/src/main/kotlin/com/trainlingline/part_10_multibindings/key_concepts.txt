- Dagger has convenience methods to help inject a map or set of bindings

- @IntoSet can generate sets of bindings automatically
- @IntoSetElements allows for

- @IntoMap can generate maps of bindings automatically
- Simple keys : @IntoMap @StringKey, @ClassKey @LongKey, @IntKey (these include compile time check for key)
- Complex keys can be created to use existing application types

- For both @IntoSet and @IntoMap subcomponents can add to inherited collections of bindings

- there is a kotlin gotcha related to variance when using @multibindings

- Qualifiers might help discoverability and help trace where the map or set is created
