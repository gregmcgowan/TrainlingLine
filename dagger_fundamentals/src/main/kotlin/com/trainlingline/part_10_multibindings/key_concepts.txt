- @IntoSet Can  generate sets of bindings automatically
- @IntoSetElements

- @IntoMap can generate maps of bindings automatically
- Simple keys : @IntoMap @StringKey, @ClassKey @LongKey, @IntKey (these include compile time check for key)
- Complex keys can be created to use existing application types

- For both types subcomponents can add to inherited collections of bindings

- there is a kotlin gotcha related to variance when using @multibindings

- Qualifiers might help discoverability
