1. How does dagger use the scope annotation?

Consider the when we had @Singleton on the @Provides for OkHttp and

Can you explain the output? What is the difference in the generated code for both scenarios?

2. Is there any other built in scope annotations? When should they be used?


Reusable is a built in scope that allows you to indicate that the object returned by a
binding may be (but might not be) reused.

It is a "special" scope as adding it will not require a @Scope to be added to the component it is
used in. Also means it can be used in any component regardless of it's scope.
