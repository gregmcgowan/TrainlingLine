- Component dependencies attribute is another mechanism to define and orgainse our graph.
We can split our graph into separate components and compose them together where needed.

- Only bindings exposed as provision methods in a component can be used in another component

- A component can include multiple other components as a dependencies

- A unscoped component cannot depend on a scoped component

- The component dependency can does not need to be annotated with @Component and can be a interface only
